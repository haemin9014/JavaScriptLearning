What is DOM?
Document Object Model:
Structured representation of HTML Documents. Allows
Javascript to access HTML elements and styles to Manipulate(change text, HTML attributes, and even CSS styles). them
=> basically we could connection points between html document and Javascript code.

DOM is automatically created by the browser as soon as the HTML page loads and it's stored in a tree structure.

DOM always starts with the document object,
document(Special object that is the entry point to the DOM) -> elements(html) -> head or body -> ....

Dom is not part of Javascript it is part of web apis
and this can interact with Javascript.
